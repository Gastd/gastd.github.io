My name is Gabriel F P Araujo and nice to meet you. I’m a mechatronics engineering student at the University of Brasilia, Brazil, and undergraduate researcher at LARA (Automation and Robotics Laboratory). I work with robotics estimation and navigation. I’m currently working with SDR development; software-defined radio for mobile robots localization using multi-constellation GNSS systems.
